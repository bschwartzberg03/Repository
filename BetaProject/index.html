            Students at the University of Maryland are only guaranteed
            university-owned housing for their freshman year. After that, they
            are entirely on their own. The result is countless apartments that
            have been developed along Route One, the road right off campus —
            Aster, Terrapin Row, College Park Towers, Landmark, The Varsity,
            University View, Tempo and The Nine —alongside other places
            currently under construction — The Standard, Aspen Heights and The
            Hub. All three of those apartments are expected to be ready by Fall
            2023.
            <br>
            <br>
            Each apartment has certain amenities — pools, gyms, study rooms and
            courtyards just to name a few — that distinguish themselves from
            their competition. With the number of apartments available in
            addition to the different amenities and locations that each provide,
            students have plenty of options for apartments once they move off
            campus. But that isn't necessarily a positive.
            <br>
            <br>
            One of the most important factors that goes into apartment hunting
            is the costs. <a href="https://www.landmarkcollegepark.com/college-park/landmark/student/" target="_blank">Landmark</a> is at the top of the list as one of the most
            expensive apartments for University of Maryland students, as the
            lowest four-bedroom, four-bathroom unit costs $1,609/month, and
            that's without any extra fees that could be thrown in. Meanwhile,
            <a href="https://live-theview.com/rates-floorplans/" target="_blank">University View</a> — one of the cheaper apartments — costs $1,290/month
            — without extra fees — for a four-bedroom, four-bathroom unit, a big
            difference in comparison to Landmark. While Landmark is seen by many
            students as the premiere apartment option, its cost is a major
            element that must be taken into account.

            Another important component when it comes to apartment hunting for
            students is the location, which varies based on certain majors. For
            journalism majors, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Terrapin+Row+Apartments,+4300+Hartwick+Rd,+College+Park,+MD+20740/Knight+Hall,+Alumni+Drive,+College+Park,+MD/@38.9834839,-76.950705,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c402db2d2305:0x30e5c2d4ab45f959!2m2!1d-76.9421281!2d38.9803202!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b7c690e7247867:0xe00bfcadfc2ebf16!2m2!1d-76.9484847!2d38.9869389!3e2" target="_blank">Terrapin Row</a> presents the best location as it’s
            the shortest walk to Knight Hall. But for computer science majors,

            <h5><strong>"The location will be very close to campus
            and close to Trader Joe's for grocery shopping." — Ryan Warrenfeltz Jr.</strong>"</h5>
        </div>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="large-12 medium-12 small-12 cell">
          <p>
            Ryan Warrenfeltz Jr., a sophomore Environmental Science and Policy
            major, decided to live at one of the new apartments, The Standard,
            for next year. Warrenfeltz valued multiple factors during his
            apartment-hunting process.
            <br />
            <br />
            "Cost was important, [and] the location will be very close to campus
            and close to Trader Joe's for grocery shopping," Warrenfeltz said.
            "The amenities and the rooms, everybody will have their own bedroom
            and a full-size bed which was nice."
            <br>
            <br>
            Landmark's cost alone put it out of contention for Warrenfeltz and his roomates.
            <br>
            <br>

            </figure>
            <br>

            It wasn't just those factors that played a role in Warrenfeltz'
            decision to live at The Standard, as he thinks it will be cool to be
            in the inaugural group for the new apartment. The apartment-hunting process wasn't easy for Warrenfeltz, as his
            roommates and he spent just under a week trying to nail a selection
            — among the countless options — for the next school year. That left
            him feeling overwhelmed at times, as he feels a lot of the places
            "seem fairly homogeneous."
            <br>
            <br>
            "It's hard to find a place to start, especially if you don't know
            anything about any of them, like having to look up each one and know
            where each one is," Warrenfeltz said.
            <br>
            <br>
            Keara Bruno, a junior Journalism major, initially looked for
            apartments in 2021, when there were less options available. She
            settled on Terrapin Row, and has decided to lease there again for
            her senior year as in her eyes, her unit has been a good living
            situation. While she didn't feel very overwhelmed — given her limited choices
            — she worries for future College Park students.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            "I think for the future with all of these apartments being built,
            it's definitely going to be overwhelming for people to decide where
            they want to live," Bruno said.
