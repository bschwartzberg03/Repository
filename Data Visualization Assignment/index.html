          <a href="https://navient.com/" target="_blank">Navient Corporation</a>
          has faced major lawsuits since 2017 as it took advantage of more than
          60,000 private student loan borrowers, per Clint Proctor of

          According to the
          <a
            href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/?chartType=line&dateInterval=Month&dateRange=3y&date_received_max=2023-04-19&date_received_min=2020-04-19&lens=Product&searchField=all&subLens=sub_product&tab=Trends"

          >, the state of Maryland featured over 25,000 complaints over the past
          year, all for a variety of issues. But one of the most common issues
          that Maryland residents complained to Navient about were issues
          relating to incorrect information of reports, 28 percent to be exact.
          Despite holding just one Big Ten school in the state, Maryland's 28
          percent of complaint issues relating to incorrect information of
          reports is up there as one of the highest among any schools in the
          conference.
          <br />
          <br />
          Illinois holds two Big Ten schools in the University of Illinois and
          Northwestern University, and the result is a drastic 42,419 complaints
          to Navient — 32 percent of those complaints were issues related to
          incorrect information of reports. Michigan — home to the University of
          Michigan and Michigan State — had 25 percent of its issues related to
          incorrect information of reports. Ohio — with just one Big Ten school
          in the state in Ohio State — is a tick below Michigan in its percent
          of issues related to incorrect information of reports at 24 percent.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of the biggest trends that can be seen between all four states is
          that many of the complaints regarded incorrect reports. In comparing
          different states that hold both one or two Big Ten schools, a good
          portion of the complaints — no matter how large the complaint pool is
          — is in regard to incorrect information. Consumer complaints about
          wrong reports existed in multiple Big Ten states, showing a trend that
          can clearly show the negative impact that Navient has left across the
          country.
